 * This OpenAPI specification describes APIs available in the Applifing Blog Engine application.

**Following APIs are exposed:**
- Authentication - This API is used for login and access token acquisition

- Image - This API serves as an image store. It is assumed that images are uploaded during article creation.
- Multitenancy - This API allows multiple blog instances to be active in a single application.

**Authorization**

All APIs except the Multitenancy API, are protected using API-KEY Token, which has either been given to the candidate during the exercise introduction or the candidate can create it themselves using the Multitenancy API `POST /tenants` endpoint. If you were already given a token, please prefer  to use it instead of creating a new one.   API-KEY Token MUST be sent like so `X-API-KEY: my-x-api-key` in the HTTP header.

Comments, Blog and Images APIs are also protected using the Access Token acquired from the `/login` EndPoint. Access Token MUST be sent like so `Authorization: my-access-token` in the HTTP header.
